# Introduction

If you have no idea what PAACS is, please read on!

### What is PAACS?

PAACS is simulation for software for a wide range of conditions, this can include structural, eletrodynamics, fluids, to name a few.

### What is a module / plugin?

With PAACS you can customise your installed applications for your specific needs. 
These modules can vary a lot in their application and we believe it better for users to only have what they need.

### What is the best ways to use PAACS?

The primary use case for PAACS is for research and/or engineering design. This could involve desinging a completely new application, or maybe obtaining simulation data to train AI models. 

We are interested in helping you **Understanding the Complex** and wherever this may lead you.
